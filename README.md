This project from the freecodecamp front end libraries cirriculum was
challenging at points. I really improved my use of prevState and also using the
e.persist(). Its needs to be refactored somewhat which I will do at a later
point as it could be done more efficently. My goal was to use classes and I will
be doing my next project with react hooks and redux.
